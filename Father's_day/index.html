     	<h1>Son of Govindarajulu</h1>

     	<p>     Yes! I missed him so much in the past couple of years. At that time I don't even know why I was weeping.. I literally don't know,
     	I just cried since everyone is crying. But soon I understand that a part of me is missing. I have this feeling of incompleteness.
     	I learned to do things alone. Went for a college admission, alone. Went to open a bank account, alone. I soon learned to do things alone, I enjoyed my own company, it happened to me turned in to an introvert. Till now I don't even know how to start a conversation with  a girl whom I like most. But in a way I was strong from inside. </p>
     	<br>
     	<p>When ever I think of him a few moments flash in to my eyes every time.</p>
     	<p>He denied signing my progress card even though I stood first in the class, he was angry at me. I only scored 121/125, it was his reason for angry, remember guy even though I toped the class</p>
     	<p>I still remember his face when I was suffering with viral fever, damn that is the face I never wanted to see, he was tensed panicked I can't express in words. At that time he was ready to anything just to save his son. remember guys it was mid night, he took me to hospital on a cycle which is around 6km far in blind darkness. Yes anyone can know that riding a bike from carmelpuram to polavaram is a blind man's task.</p>
     	<p>making banana juice and offering us when we tired after playing.</p>
     	<p>Blessing with his belt, how can anyone forgot those.</p>
     	<p>He, playing cricket with us. You know one day he took both my brother and me picked us in the middle of school saying that we have doctor's appointment, just to watch a cricket match.</p>
     	<p>How can I forget this, I don't remember the exact year as I was so young, entire polavaram was flooded and our house was submerged under water. Unfortunately he's out of town, We have no where to go, we were on top of a building just surviving. I really don't how he came, he came and carrying me and my brother one by one to a boat to go a safer place. we have to swim to reach a boat. I still feel what a d88k i was when ever I remember this, I held his neck so hard that I made him hard to breathe and pulling down in to the waters but he managed to take me. </p>
     	<p>He polish our shoes daily even we made them look like ash sprayed. I can list many things and it will go on</p>
     	<p>One thing is that I also have to keep the saddest moments, his body was wrapped in a sheet, blood flowing out of his mouth and someone was cleaning it all the time. 
     	Fate is that after year it happened that i joined in a college near where he was pronounced as dead. GSL medical college gate, whenever I saw that gate every thing flashed in my mind. </p>
     	<p> But I never made anything in my life to make him proud. Everyday I feel bad that I did nothing to full fill his dreams. I'm sorry nanna. I was an unlucky bastard, I didn't got to spend much time with you. your are my hero, my role model. you never know how much I missed you, I cry silently during night with my blanket on, sometime tears just roll down my cheek I don't why.  </p>
